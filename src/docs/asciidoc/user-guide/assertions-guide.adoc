[[assertj-core-assertions-guide]]
== Core assertions guide

This section describes the assertions provided by AssertJ Core and other useful features to get the best of it.

[[assertj-core-simple-example]]
=== A simple example

Let's start with a simple example showing a few important things.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/SimpleAssertionsExample.java[tags=user_guide]
----
<1> Statically import `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat`
<2> Pass the object under test as the sole `assertThat()` parameter
<3> Use code completion to discover and call assertions
<4> Chain as many assertions as you need

Except for `isNotNull` which is a base assertion, the other assertions are `String` specific as our object under test is a `String`.

[[assertj-core-supported-types]]
=== Supported type assertions

AssertJ provides assertions specific to the object under test type, the following sections list the supported types grouped by categories.

The provided assertions for each of these types are documented later on.

[[assertj-core-assertion-description]]
=== Assertion description

It is often valuable to describe the assertion performed, especially for boolean assertions where the default error message just complains that it got `false` instead of `true` (or vice versa).

You can set such a description with `as(String description, Object... args)` but remember to do it before calling the assertion otherwise it is simply ignored as a failing assertion breaks the chained calls.

Example of a failing assertion with a description:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/DescribingAssertionsExample.java[tags=user_guide]
----

The error message starts with the given description in `[]` :

[source,nnm,indent=0]
----
[check Frodo's age] expected:<100> but was:\<33>
----

[[assertj-core-assertion-description]]
=== Overriding error message

AssertJ tries its best to give helpful error messages but you always change it with `overridingErrorMessage()` or `withFailMessage()`.

Example with this failing test:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/OverridingErrorMessageExample.java[tags=user_guide]
----

The error message is:

[source,nnm,indent=0]
----
java.lang.AssertionError: should be TolkienCharacter [name=Frodo, age=33, race=HOBBIT]
----


[[assertj-core-incorrect-usage]]
=== Avoiding incorrect usage

There are a few things to keep in mind when using AssertJ to avoid misusing it. 

==== Forgetting to call an assertion

The main trap is to pass the object under to test to `assertThat()` and forget to call an assertion afterward.
This misuse can be detected by https://spotbugs.github.io/[SpotBugs] or http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/[Findbugs] thanks to the `@CheckReturnValue` annotation on all `assertThat()` methods.

Here's what it looks like in SpotBugs:
[#img-sunset]
.SpotBugs detecting AssertJ invalid usage
image::spotbugs-invalid-assertj-usage-detection.png[SpotBugs detecting AssertJ invalid usage]

The following examples show incorrect AssertJ API usage to avoid!

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! It does not assert anything
assertThat(actual.equals(expected));

----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS:
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected);

// OR THIS (less classy but ok):
assertThat(actual.equals(expected)).isTrue();
----

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! It does not assert anything and passes
assertThat(1 == 2);

----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS: (fails as expected)
assertThat(1).isEqualTo(2);

// OR THIS (less classy but ok):
assertThat(1 == 2).isTrue();
----

==== Calling as() after the assertion

Describing an assertion must be done before calling the assertion otherwise it is ignored as a failing assertion breaks will prevent the call to `as()`.

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! as/describedAs have no effect after the assertion
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).as("description");
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).describedAs("description");
----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS: use as/describedAs before the assertion
assertThat(actual).as("description").isEqualTo(expected);
assertThat(actual).describedAs("description").isEqualTo(expected);
----

==== Calling withFailMessage/overridingErrorMessage after the assertion

Setting an error message must be done before calling the assertion otherwise it is ignored as a failing assertion breaks will prevent the call to `withFailMessage()` / `overridingErrorMessage()`.

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! overridingErrorMessage/withFailMessage have no effect after the assertion
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).overridingErrorMessage("custom error message");
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).withFailMessage("custom error message");
----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS: use overridingErrorMessage/withFailMessage before the assertion
assertThat(actual).overridingErrorMessage("custom error message").isEqualTo(expected);
assertThat(actual).withFailMessage("custom error message").isEqualTo(expected);
----

==== Setting a comparator after the assertion

Setting comparators must be done before calling the assertion otherwise it is ignored as a failing assertion breaks will prevent the call to `usingComparator()` / `usingElementComparator()`.

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! Comparator is not used
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).usingComparator(new CustomComparator());
----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS:
assertThat(actual).usingComparator(new CustomComparator()).isEqualTo("a");
----

[[assertj-core-representation]]
=== Controlling type formatting

Assertions error messages use a `Representation` to format the different types involved. There are multiple ways of registering a custom `Representation` for assertions:

* Registering a default global `Representation` via a Service Provider Interface (SPI) - see <<Registering a default global scope custom representation>> for details.
* Changing the default global `Representation` by calling `Assertions.useRepresentation(myRepresentation)` - see <<Changing the default global scope custom representation>>
* Changing the `Representation` per assertion with `assertThat(actual).withRepresentation(myRepresentation)` - see <<Per assertion scope custom representation>>

The advantage of registering a service is that you don't need any programmatic call, AssertJ will pick it up and use it as the default `Representation`.

Let's go over these different options with a custom `Representation`.

[[assertj-core-custom-representation]]
==== Creating a custom Representation

An example of a custom `Representation`:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// dummy class
private class Example {} 

public class CustomRepresentation extends StandardRepresentation { // <1>

  // override fallbackToStringOf to handle Example formatting
  @Override
  public String fallbackToStringOf(Object o) { // <2> 
    if (o instanceof Example) return "Example";
    // fallback to default formatting.
    return super.fallbackToStringOf(o);
  }

  // override a predefined type formatting : String
  @Override
  protected String toStringOf(String str) { // <3>
    return "$" + str + "$";
  }
}
----
<1> Extends `org.assertj.core.presentation.StandardRepresentation` to get AssertJ default representation.
<2> Override `fallbackToStringOf` and handle your specific types before falling back to the default formatting.
<3> Change a predefined type formatting by overridding the `toStringOf` method that takes it as a parameter.

Let's see the above custom representation in action when representing `Example` or `String` instances.

This assertion fails ...
[source,java,indent=0]
----
assertThat(new Example()).isNull();
----
...with the following error:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
expected:<[null]> but was:<[Example]>
----

This one fails ...
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// this one fails ...
assertThat("foo").startsWith("bar");
----
...with the following error:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
Expecting:
  <$foo$>
to start with:
  <$bar$>
----

[[assertj-core-custom-representation-default-global-scope]]
==== Registering a default global scope custom representation

You will need to register your `Representation` as an SPI. You need to do the following for that:

* Create a file named `org.assertj.core.presentation.Representation` in the `META-INF/services` directory
* Put the fully qualified class name of your `Representation` in it
* Make sure `META-INF/services/org.assertj.core.presentation.Representation` is in the runtime classpath, usually putting it in `src/test/resources` is enough

This all you have to do as AssertJ will pick up the `Representation` automatically.

[[assertj-core-custom-representation-global-scope-change]]
==== Changing the default global scope custom representation

You only have to register `CustomRepresentation` once but need to do it before executing any tests, for the tests executed before that, AssertJ will use the default representation.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
// to call before executing tests
Assertions.useRepresentation(new CustomRepresentation());
----

[[assertj-core-custom-representation-per-assertion-scope]]
==== Per assertion scope custom representation

Follow this approach if you want to use a specific representation for a single assertion only.

Example with the failing assertions used before:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
Representation customRepresentation = new CustomRepresentation();

// this assertion fails ...
assertThat(new Example()).withRepresentation(customRepresentation)
                         .isNull();

assertThat("foo").withRepresentation(customRepresentation)
                 .startsWith("bar");                         
----


[[assertj-core-representation]]
=== Custom representation

Assertions error messages use a `Representation` to format different types involved. 
It is possible to create your own `Representation` as explained in the following sections, once this is done it must be registered for AssertJ to use it.

==== Changing types representation

It is possible to change any type representations either the ones AssertJ knows (like `String`) or your own types, the `CustomRepresentation` below shows how to do that.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/CustomRepresentation.java[tags=user_guide]
----
<1> extends `StandardRepresentation` to benefit from AssertJ standard representation
<2> override `fallbackToStringOf(Object)` to set your own type representation (e.g. `TolkienCharacter`)
<3> override `toStringOf(String)` to change AssertJ `String` representation (or any other AssertJ known type)

After you registering your custom representation, AssertJ will use it in error messages:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
// this assertion fails ...
assertThat(new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 33, Race.HOBBIT)).isNull();
// ... with error :
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: 
Expecting:
 <TolkienCharacter Frodo>
to be equal to:
 <null>
but was not.

// this one fails ...
assertThat("foo").startsWith("bar");
// ... with error :
Expecting:
  <$foo$>
to start with:
  <$bar$>
----

==== Registering your custom representation

There are multiple ways to register a custom representation for assertions:

===== Global scope with Service Provider Interface

Since 2.9.0 / 3.9.0, one can register an implementation of `Representation` via a Service Provider Interface (SPI). This will cause AssertJ to use that assertion per default all the time. There is no need to call `Assertions.useRepresentation(myRepresentation)`. 

To register a custom `Representation` via a Service Provider Interface, follow these steps:

. Create a file named `org.assertj.core.presentation.Representation` in the `META-INF/services` directory
. Put the fully qualified class name of your `Representation` in it
. Make sure `META-INF/services/org.assertj.core.presentation.Representation` is in the runtime classpath, usually putting it in `src/test/resources` is enough 

Note that calling `Assertions.useDefaultRepresentation()` will actually use the SPI registered `Representation`

===== Global scope

After calling `Assertions.useRepresentation(myRepresentation)` AssertJ will use `myRepresentation` globally.

===== Per assertion scope

Calling `assertThat(actual).withRepresentation(myRepresentation)` will cause AssertJ to use the given representation for the assertions chained afterward.

== AssertJ Sample Projects

The https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-examples/tree/master/assertions-examples[assertions-examples] repository hosts executable AssertJ assertions examples that you can run as JUnit tests. Please have a look at assertions https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-examples/tree/master/assertions-examples/src/test/java/org/assertj/examples[examples sources].

The `master` branch contains examples with the latest released version of AssertJ modules for Java 8, similarly the `java-7` branch contains examples of AssertJ modules for Java 7. You should be able to build those two branches with `mvn clean install` command.

In your IDE, add `src/test/generated-assertions` to the project java test sources otherwise you will have errors/missing classes. This is the folder where custom assertions classes are generated by default by the maven assertions generator plugin. Note that Intellij Idea wrongly adds `src/test/generated-assertions` to the production sources when it should be added the test sources, you will have to fix that in your module/project settings.

Building the `with-latest-snapshot-versions` branch is a bit more complicated :

* you need to build the needed SNAPSHOT dependencies before - most probably assertj-core and maybe other modules.
* run `mvn clean install` in assertj-examples/assertions-examples.
* In your IDE, add `src/test/generated-assertions` to the project java sources if you IDE shows errors/missing classes.
