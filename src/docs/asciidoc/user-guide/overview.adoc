programmers writing tests, extension authors, and engine authors as well as build tool
and IDE vendors.

[[overview-what-is-assertj]]
=== What is AssertJ?

AssertJ is a java library providing a rich set of assertions, truly helpful error messages, improves test code readability and is designed to be super easy to use within your favorite IDE.

[[overview-java-versions]]
=== Supported Java Versions

Different AssertJ major versions depend on different Java versions :

* AssertJ 3.x requires Java 8 or higher (use the `org.assertj.core.api.Java6Assertions` entry point on Android API Level < 26)
* AssertJ 2.x requires Java 7 or higher (use the `org.assertj.core.api.Java6Assertions` entry point on Android API Level < 26)
* AssertJ 1.x requires Java 6 or higher

Note that AssertJ 3.x includes all AssertJ 2.x features and adds Java 8 specific ones (like exception assertions with lambdas).

== Quick start

This guide is for the AssertJ core module.

[[get-assertj-core]]
=== Get assertj-core library

AssertJ artifacts are in the Maven central repository.

==== Maven

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.assertj</groupId>
  <artifactId>assertj-core</artifactId>
  <!-- use 2.9.1 for Java 7 projects -->
  <version>3.11.0</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

==== Gradle

For Gradle users (using the Maven Central Repository)

[source,java,indent=0]
----
testCompile("org.assertj:assertj-core:3.11.0")
----

Or version 2.9.1 for Java 7 projects

[source,java,indent=0]
----
testCompile("org.assertj:assertj-core:2.9.1")
----

==== Other dependency management tool

Check this page to find the relevant https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.assertj/assertj-core/3.11.0/bundle[assertj dependency declaration].

=== Add assertj entry point

One static import to rule them all ...

[source,java,indent=0]
----
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;
----

\... or many if you prefer

[source,java,indent=0]
----
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;  // main one
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.atIndex; // for List assertions
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.entry;  // for Map assertions
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.tuple; // when extracting several properties at once
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.fail; // use when writing exception tests
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown; // idem
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.filter; // for Iterable/Array assertions
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.offset; // for floating number assertions
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.anyOf; // use with Condition
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.contentOf; // use with File assertions
----

On Android (API Level < 26) use this static import :

[source,java,indent=0]
----
import static org.assertj.core.api.Java6Assertions.*;
----

You can configure your IDE so that when you start typing `as` and trigger code completion `assertThat` will show up in the suggested completions.

==== Eclipse configuration

. Go to : Window > Preferences > Java > Editor > Content Assist > Favorites > New Type
. Enter : `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions` and click OK
. Check that you see `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*`` in Favorites.

==== Intellij Idea configuration

No special configuration is needed, just start typing `asser` and then invoke completion (Ctrl-Space) twice.

=== Use code completion

Type assertThat followed by the object under test and a dot ... and any Java IDE code completion will show you all available assertions.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
assertThat(objectUnderTest). # <1>
----
<1> Use Code completion after the dot.
